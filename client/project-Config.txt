STEP 1 — Build the ResumeUpload UI

✔ You already have this
✔ UI is fully responsive, dark mode compatible
✔ Supports drag/drop + browse
✔ Shows selected file
✔ Button + loader
✔ Ready for backend connection

➡️ Upload UI = COMPLETED

STEP 2 — Build Backend Upload API (Node.js + Express)

This is the next required step.

We need:

✔ Backend route /api/resume/upload
✔ Accept PDF/DOC/DOCX
✔ Save file temporarily
✔ Extract text (using pdf-parse, docx, or LibreOffice)
✔ Send extracted text to AI model
✔ Generate:

strengths

weaknesses

ats score

suggestions

➡️ This is what we implement next.

STEP 3 — Connect Frontend Upload → Backend API

Once server API is ready:

Frontend sends file via FormData

Backend responds with { id, analysis, text }

Store in localStorage

Redirect to /analysis

➡️ Integration step


STEP 4 — Testing Upload Process

We test:

✔ Upload success
✔ Invalid file popup
✔ File > 5MB
✔ Drag and drop
✔ API errors
✔ AI response
